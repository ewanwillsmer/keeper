# Keeper 

Keeper is a basic version of the Google Keep app. I coded this app during a series of challenges in The App Brewery "The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp" React module.

## Usage 

This app allows you make a note and at a later time delete it.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Acknowledgment 

Once again, thank you to Angela Yu at The App Brewery for writing the initial app.
